    The views, personal limitations and geographical differences of some of the country's progressive elites. The theory is divided into two parts. Some see the 

Taliban as a dark and reactionary group, and see their rule over Kabul as a major setback for the Afghan system and governance. Some see the Taliban as a 

liberating force and the cause of American defeat. They are happy that the faction has been ousted and replaced by the Taliban. For this group, first of 

all, the achievements of the last few weeks, such as the elimination of corrupt and regulatory circles, are very important and they are not too worried 

about the future value of this change. The Taliban took control of Kabul in a historic deal with the United States. They drove the faction out of the 

political arena. The security situation has greatly improved as the Taliban have become the ruling class of the country and are no longer involved in the 

armed struggle. But the cost of Taliban rule is very high for our country. The price can be divided into two parts: 
1) Economic and social cost 
2) Political 

and geopolitical cost The Kabul Taliban's actions in a short period of time have politically isolated the country, disrupted human resource management, and 

excluded women from the economic and social environment. The lack of representation of other ethnic groups and territories in the system, the representation 

of the power of only a few families in the government, blocked the way for the training of a new generation of Afghans for the future and ultimately blocked 

Afghanistan's trade with the outside world. . These are all social and economic costs that our country is paying for peace. The Taliban also played a 

geopolitical role in world politics. With their coming to power, all regional and international powers were engaged in renewing their security interests. 

The world order that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union is crumbling. The acquisition of Taiwan from Central Asia has had an impact on the 

Indian subcontinent and even Europe's security and strategic integrity. The Taliban in Kabul last month
