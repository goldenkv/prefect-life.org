    yar. Mohammad Taraki's Death -
      <h2> Fresh Fight</h2> <h1> Dr. Yar Mohammad Taraki's</h1> October is the beginning of autumn and October is the month of leaf fall. I really don't like this month. I lost my father that same month. In the same month (October 1 - October 1), the date of the brutal assassination of Noor Mohammad Taraki was also recorded. The martyrdom of Noor Mohammad Taraki not only lost his name, but his character and struggles, like the scorpion under the aurora, still shine brightly for forty-two years. Taraki's political influence is felt in many progressive, scientific, literary and artistic circles. More and more university theses and monographs have been written on the life, works and struggles of Noor Mohammad Taraki. Prominent writers and biographers have published books on Taraki. This is an example of the greatness of a great man. Revolutions are often time consuming and quick decisions are made. I remember days and months full of disagreements over issues, appointments of officials, making sound decisions, full of emotions and reading. Noor Mohammad Taraki was the oldest but most experienced person in the group. Try harder to expose personality traits, corruption, gifts and taxes. The white beard did not go unnoticed in the art of power. He turned his back on the money, reacting strongly to the person's request. Or ban the posting of the President's portrait. Many will ask, what was the great leader who could not take care of his immediate environment? Many would say that if he had been a great leader he would have stayed in power for a long time. Some questions are precise and intelligent questions that need to be answered accurately and intelligently. But sometimes a person spends a night in an environment or stays as the president of a country for only one year but his political, moral and civic influence is such that other kings and leaders are influenced by him. Noor Mohammad Taraki for the first time in the open air talking and criticizing ordinary people such as farmers, civil servants, workers, artists and others.
